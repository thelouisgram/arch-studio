### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
- The Name, Email or Message fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
 -The Email is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
